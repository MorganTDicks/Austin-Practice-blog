# README

## Description
This project uses Next.JS with React & TypeScript to create a blogging website currently consisting of my own dummy blogs. 

The current scope is to display the posts on the blog, whilst also allowing visitors to log in. 

Once a visitor is logged in, they must then be able to add comments to posts, or suggest new posts of their own. 

Allow myself to post new posts, edit existing posts, approve of suggested posts & comment / reply to comments.
