# Doccumentation: 

## Initialised the repository using the following git commands: 
//  Navigated to the project folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Austin-ALIT/Austin-Practice-blog.git
git flow init (Replied yes to everything)
// Git flow created a few extra branches that may not be used. If unused, will delete them at the end. 

## Creating the base next app
// renamed the project folder to all lower case
npx create-next-app --typescript .
// Selected no to all addons -- THIS MAKES THE PROGRAM SHOW A BLANK PAGE WHEN RUNNING
// Instead, i said yes to evverything except using the app router, and I left the import alias default. 

## First develop branch
// Changed to branch: Develop
// Added: 
	// Basic Home Page layout
	// Basic Styling & Banner Image
	// Navigation bar Component
	// Header Banner Component
	// Comments about future plans (Will move these to doccumentation at a later stage)

## Currently working on:
Now, Switching to feature branch to work on Pages feature. 
// Will use an array to store page data, and import it using dynamic pages
// This array will later fetch from an external data source (like a database)
// Page additions (such as comments) are still being decided on how to be implimented. 

### Feature Commit 1: 
// Added posts page, listing all the posts.
// Added dynamic posts page, listing post content.  
// Added data importer, which will be used to fetch data from the database. 
	// Currently just returns the posts array, this will change in future

// For the main page: 
// Made the navigation Bar sticky
// Added Basic footer
// Adjusted header banner dimentions sligtly. 
// Put in plan a toolbar which will be on the top banner, with icons for home on the left and user info on the right. 

### ToDO: 
// Change DataImporter to have internal functions rather than just return posts. 
// Order Posts page by recent activity
// Create User Type declaration
// Add styling to Posts Page
// Create Search Bar Component (Separate Feature Branch)?
