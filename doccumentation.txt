# Doccumentation: 

## Initialised the repository using the following git commands: 
//  Navigated to the project folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Austin-ALIT/Austin-Practice-blog.git
git flow init (Replied yes to everything)
// Git flow created a few extra branches that may not be used. If unused, will delete them at the end. 

## Creating the base next app
// renamed the project folder to all lower case
npx create-next-app --typescript .
// Selected no to all addons -- THIS MAKES THE PROGRAM SHOW A BLANK PAGE WHEN RUNNING
// Instead, i said yes to evverything except using the app router, and I left the import alias default.

// Changed to branch: Develop
// Added: 
	// Basic Home Page layout
	// Basic Styling & Banner Image
	// Navigation bar Component

	// Comments about future plans (Will move these to doccumentation at a later stage)

## Currently working on:
Now, Switching to feature branch to work on Pages feature. 
// Will use an array to store page data, and import it using dynamic pages
// This array will later fetch from an external data source (like a database)
// Page additions (such as comments) are still being decided on how to be implimented. 

### Feature Commit 1: 
// Added posts page, listing all the posts.
// Added dynamic posts page, listing post content.

	// Currently just returns the posts array, this will change in future

// For the main page: 
// Made the navigation Bar sticky

// Change DataImporter to have internal functions rather than just return posts. 
	// Could not get this to work. Mde sseprte dt importers for now.
	// merge dt importers.  
// Fixed, using a dictionry 

Stuff that will bankrupt me: 
Adding a smooth collapsing animation to the header banner when user scrolls down - (1/2) got the bnner working so fr
making 'show topics' and 'contact me' collapsable side bars instead of their own pages
Allowing each page to have its own banner image (dynamic css background images)
	Allowing each post to have a unique banner, or just default if no banner is present. (Set default bannerpath and default topic)
Making an image carousel for the recent posts section
Search comparing input to all existing posts as the user types. Search just takes in the theme and what they types, then returns it (as a prop for a master module, maybe?)
Logging in and creating an account functionality
Adding a Star / Subscribe system for posts the user follows. 
Adding tags
Counting number of page views
Making page browser when above 10 pages.

/* Figured out how to run the app to test it. - Seemed to be an issue with typescript and react.
  Troubleshooting steps: 

  ran npm run dev, got a blank page. 
  # restarted the program
  ran 'npm start' got an error saying .next is empty, run next build
  ran next build, command not recodnised
  ran npm next build, next not recodnised
  ran npx next build, worked. installed build and built the project. 
  ran 'npm start' finished with an error that some dependancies are missing
  ran npx tsc --watch, found zero errors
  ran npx next build, > Export encountered errors on following paths:
        /
        /_error: /404
        /_error: /500
  ran npm start, encountered same error as last time: 
        type: 'Error',
        code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
        requireStack: [
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\next-server.js',
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\next.js',
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\lib\\render-server.js',
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\compiled\\jest-worker\\processChild.js'
  // FIXED: Use Src/ directory format for typescript when installing nextjs.
