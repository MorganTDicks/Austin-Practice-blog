# Doccumentation: 

# Sprint 1
// Focus: Creating home page, initialising git & git flow, initialising the next.ts app. 

## Initialised the repository using the following git commands: 
//  Navigated to the project folder
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/Austin-ALIT/Austin-Practice-blog.git
git flow init (Replied yes to everything)
// Git flow created a few extra branches that may not be used. If unused, will delete them at the end. 

## Creating the base next app
// renamed the project folder to all lower case
npx create-next-app --typescript .
// Selected no to all addons -- THIS MAKES THE PROGRAM SHOW A BLANK PAGE WHEN RUNNING
// Instead, i said yes to everything except using the app router, and I left the import alias default. 

## First develop branch
// Changed to branch: Develop
// Added: 
	// Basic Home Page layout
	// Basic Styling & Banner Image
	// Navigation bar Component
	// Header Banner Component
	// Comments about future plans (Will move these to doccumentation at a later stage)

## Commits

### FilterSearch Stash 1: 
// Changes stashed. 
// Searchfilter component must fetch user input and filter, then use context to compile & display in another module. 

### Develop Commit: 
// Changed Type Declarations to no longer be global (Thanks to Morgan)
// Allowed previewContent & fetchUser functions to be exported and therefore globally accessible.
// Cleaned up a bit of messy comments here and there.  


### User Feature Commit 1: 
// Created skeleton for login, dashboard & create account. 
// Created navigation between login, dashboard & create account. 
// Investigated why it shows errors when initially starting.
  // Fixed. Is an issue with Nextjs and tables when table does not contain <tbody>. credit: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73890509/why-is-using-a-table-in-next-js-throwing-a-hydration-error


## Currently working on:
// Logging in and creating an account functionality
// Linking home page to !(logged in)? Login : User dashboard;
// Creating Profile Dashboard
// Investigating context usage to keep user info across pages.

### ToDO: 

// Editing User type to allow for followed users, followed posts, followed topics?  


// Hide postcarousel buttons when at end. 
// Fix post title overlapping (see post: bike driver's in the dev preview to understand)
// Replace toolbar text with icons. 
// adding styling to dynamic post page
// Replace the page-not-found page. 

Other Features:

// Create Search Bar Component (Separate Feature Branch)?
// Users profile Page
// Topics 
// Suggesting & Adding Posts
// Deleting Posts
// Adding, editing and deleting comments. 

Skipped: 
// Find out how to use props with React.FC type function - skipped as react cn ssume function types utomaticlly. 
// Find out how to do justified passing on navbar? - skipped, found n lterntive.
// Change DataImporter to have internal functions rather than just return posts. 
	// Could not get this to work. Mde sseprte dt importers for now.
	// merge dt importers.  
  // Fixed, using a dictionry 

### Stuff that will bankrupt me: 
// Order Posts page by recent activity
// Adding a smooth collapsing animation to the header banner when user scrolls down - (1/2) got the bnner working so fr
// making 'show topics' and 'contact me' collapsable side bars instead of their own pages
// Allowing each page to have its own banner image (dynamic css background images)
	// Allowing each post to have a unique banner, or just default if no banner is present. (Set default bannerpath and default topic)
// Making an image carousel for the recent posts section
// Search comparing input to all existing posts as the user types. Search just takes in the theme and what they types, then returns it (as a prop for a master module, maybe?)
// Adding a Star / Subscribe system for posts the user follows. 
// Adding tags
// Counting number of page views
// Making page browser when above 10 pages.
// Allowing users to upload an image when creating an account / post. 

/* Figured out how to run the app to test it. - Seemed to be an issue with typescript and react.
  Troubleshooting steps: 

  ran npm run dev, got a blank page. 
  # restarted the program
  ran 'npm start' got an error saying .next is empty, run next build
  ran next build, command not recodnised
  ran npm next build, next not recodnised
  ran npx next build, worked. installed build and built the project. 
  ran 'npm start' finished with an error that some dependancies are missing
  ran npx tsc --watch, found zero errors
  ran npx next build, > Export encountered errors on following paths:
        /
        /_error: /404
        /_error: /500
  ran npm start, encountered same error as last time: 
        type: 'Error',
        code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND',
        requireStack: [
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\next-server.js',
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\next.js',
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\server\\lib\\render-server.js',
          'C:\\Users\\User\\Projects\\austin-practice-blog\\node_modules\\next\\dist\\compiled\\jest-worker\\processChild.js'
  // FIXED: Use Src/ directory format for typescript when installing nextjs.
